# Day 1 â€“ Folder and File Automation

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates basic automation tasks using Python to improve business efficiency. It focuses on creating dated folders and generating multiple report files automatically.

## Features

- Creates a folder named with the current date, e.g., `Reports_2025_05_25`
- Generates three files inside the folder: `summary.txt`, `details.txt`, and `log.txt`
- Writes initial log content and appends timestamps whenever the script runs
- Checks if folders or files already exist before creating to prevent overwriting

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `os` module for file system operations
- `datetime` module for date/time management
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `folder_file_automation.ipynb`
2. Run the cells step-by-step to see the folder and files created
3. Modify file names or folder naming scheme as needed for your use case

## Next Steps

- Add input prompts for dynamic folder and file naming
- Implement error handling for permission issues
- Expand file manipulation to include reading and cleanup tasks
